[Codius](https://codius.org) is an open-source decentralized hosting platform using [Interledger](https://interledger.org). It allows anyone to run software on servers all over the world and pay using any currency. Users package their software inside of [containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container). Multiple containers can run together inside of a [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/).

**Codiusd** (Codius Daemon; this software) is the server-side component. You can run one or more *codiusd* hosts in your datacenter and Codius clients will pay you to run their software. Codiusd uses [hyperd](https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperd) to provide hardware-level isolation between different pods.

## Prerequisites

* CentOS 7 or higher
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 10 or higher
* A processor with [virtualization support](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/KVM#head-6cbcdf8f149ebcf19d53199a30eb053a9fc482db)

## Installation

First, you need to install [hyperd](https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperd). Once hyperd is installed, please make sure it is working correctly:

##### Command line
```sh
sudo hyperctl run -t hello-world
```

##### Expected Output
```
$ sudo hyperctl run -t hello-world
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/
For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/
```

If you don't see the "Hello from Docker!" message, please troubleshoot your hyperd installation before proceeding.

Once hyperd is installed and working, you can install Codius Host.

```sh
sudo npm install -g codiusd
```
### Environment Variables

#### CODIUS_COST_PER_MONTH
* Type: Integer
* Description: A monthly rate the host charges (in XRP) to host a program. `Codiusd` calculates this value down to the rate per second, as uploads are given a time in seconds to be hosted for.
* Default: 10

#### CODIUS_HYPER_SOCKET
* Type: String
* Description: The absolute path to the `hyperd` socket.
* Default: `/var/run/hyper.sock`

#### CODIUS_HYPER_NOOP
* Type: Boolean
* Description: Noops all `hyperd` API calls.
* Default: false

#### CODIUS_PORT
* Type: [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)
* Description: The port that codiusd will listen on.
* Default: 3000

#### CODIUS_PUBLIC_URI
* Type: String
* Description: The public URI resolving to this instance of codiusd.
* Default: `http://local.codius.org:CODIUS_PORT`

#### CODIUS_MAX_MEMORY_FRACTION
* Type: Number
* Description: Amount of memory to allocate to codiusd for hosting.
* Default: 0.75

#### CODIUS_ADDITIONAL_HOST_INFO
* Type: Boolean
* Description: Gives info about the host such as uptime, contracts currently running, monthly fee, etc. You can view this info at the /info endpoint, e.g. `codius.example.com/info`
* Default: false

#### CODIUS_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS
* Type: JSON Array
* Description: List of peers whose values are the URIs that resolve to their Codius instance.
* Default: [ ]

### API Documentation
#### `POST /pods?duration=TIME_TO_LIVE`
Create a pod that runs a given [Codius Manifest](https://github.com/coilhq/codius-manifest) and purchases the amount of time that the host will run it using [Interledger](https://interledger.org)

###### hyperd doesn't start containers on restart

See:

  * <https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperd/issues/654>
  * <https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperd/issues/715>

The hyperd logs will have errors like:

    E0605 ...   persist.go:100] Pod[...] failed to load inf info of : leveldb: not found

As a temporary workaround, offending containers can be removed from `/var/lib/hyper/containers/`, which will allow them to be started again fresh.
