=head1 NAME

parcat - cat files or fifos in parallel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<parcat> [--rm] [-#] file(s) [-#] file(s)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GNU B<parcat> reads files or fifos in parallel. It writes full lines
so there will be no problem with mixed-half-lines which you risk if
you use:

   (cat file1 & cat file2 &) | ...

Arguments can be given on the command line or passed in on stdin
(standard input).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 9

=item -B<#>

Arguments following this will be sent to the file descriptor B<#>. E.g.

  parcat -1 stdout1 stdout2 -2 stderr1 stderr2

will send I<stdout1> and I<stdout2> to stdout (standard output = file
descriptor 1), and send I<stderr1> and I<stderr2> to stderr (standard
error = file descriptor 2).

=item --rm

Remove files after opening. As soon as the files are opened, unlink
the files.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Simple line buffered output

GNU Parallel saves output to tempfiles. If the amount of data is
bigger than the free disk space, then you can use this technique to do
line buffering without saving to disk:

  mkfifo slot-{1..5}
  seq 10000000 | parallel -j5 --round --pipe 'cat > slot-{%}' &
  parcat slot-{1..5} | wc

=head1 REPORTING BUGS

GNU B<parcat> is part of GNU B<parallel>. Report bugs to
